# Match_Pair
# Memory Game

A simple memory game built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The objective of the game is to flip two cards at a time and match pairs. Cards will only remain flipped if they are a pair. If they don't match, they will flip back. The game tracks and remembers the state of the flipped cards and only locks them in place if they are matched correctly.
